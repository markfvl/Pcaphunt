For the _not DGA_ domains in the datasets it has been used a part of **Alexa TOP 1M Domains**, whereas for what it concerns the _DGA_ domains
I have used the **DGA Domain Feed** provided by [John Bambenek](https://www.bambenekconsulting.com/) and another small part has been generated with the tool
[domain_generation_algorithms](https://github.com/baderj/domain_generation_algorithms).

If the extraction of the file *dataset_sample.zip* fails or runs into problems, you can download the original _csv file_ 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hCZP9nv2egSwNO8X-5bQ4W6KSMNu1EG1/view?usp=drive_link). Meanwhile the _complete dataset_ (~2M entries) 
is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IQ2YSFkXEkhX54PXAmBBeyk7qJi4VrZE/view?usp=drive_link), this file is quite heavy, therefore it has been compressed in a zip 
file (~67MB, that once decompressed will be around 250MB).
